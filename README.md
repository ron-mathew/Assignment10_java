ðŸ§µ Java Multithreading Demonstration
ðŸ“Œ Assignment Description
This project is a modular Java application designed to demonstrate the concept of Multithreading in Java. The application follows object-oriented principles and good coding practices, with each functionality encapsulated in a separate class and file. It uses the Runnable interface and Thread class to simulate multiple tasks running concurrently.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Understand and demonstrate multithreading using Java.

Use multiple threads to execute different tasks concurrently.

Apply modular design by separating each thread logic into different Java files.

Follow proper coding guidelines including naming conventions, logical separation, and use of comments.

Simulate real-time delays and execution control using Thread.sleep() and exception handling.

ðŸ§± Technologies Used
Java (Standard Edition)

OOP Concepts â€“ Classes, packages, modularity

Threads â€“ Using Runnable interface and Thread class

ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes
Learn how to create and manage threads using Java.

Understand concurrent execution of independent tasks.

Use Runnable interface and Thread class effectively.

Design applications using modular and maintainable code.

Improve problem-solving by simulating real-world parallel operations.
